        <h1 id="When-Did-They-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-Through-18-to-21"><a href="#When-Did-They-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-Through-18-to-21" class="headerlink" title="When Did They Raise the Gambling Age Through 18 to 21?"></a>When Did They Raise the Gambling Age Through 18 to 21?</h1><p>The gambling age through 18 to 21 has been around for quite some time. Back in 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed, which made it illegal for gambling businesses to knowingly accept payments from American customers using certain payment processors. This law made it harder for online poker rooms and casinos to process payments from players in the United States.</p>
<p>While the law may have discouraged some people from gambling online, it did not actually change the gambling age. That changed in 2011, when the National Gambling Impact Study Commission recommended that the legal gambling age be raised to 21. Their reasoning was that this would help protect young people from developing addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>In October 2011, Congress passed a bill that raised the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The legislation also prohibited credit card companies from processing payments for online gambling transactions. This made it much more difficult for people under 21 to gamble online.</p>
<p>The new law went into effect on December 1, 2011. It applies to all forms of gambling, including casinos, racetracks, lotteries, and tribal gaming establishments. While there was some opposition to the bill, most lawmakers agreed that it was necessary to protect young people from developing harmful addictions.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-Commission-Votes-in-Favor-of-Gambling-Age-Increase"><a href="#Gaming-Commission-Votes-in-Favor-of-Gambling-Age-Increase" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Commission Votes in Favor of Gambling Age Increase"></a>Gaming Commission Votes in Favor of Gambling Age Increase</h1><p>Yesterday, the state gaming commission voted unanimously in favor of increasing the gambling age from 18 to 21. The proposal, which was first introduced by Governor Jerry Brown last month, will now be sent to the state legislature for a vote.</p>
<p>If passed, the new law would make California the latest state to raise its gambling age. Last year, both Maine and Hawaii increased their gambling ages to 21.</p>
<p>Supporters of the proposal argue that it will help protect young people from developing gambling addictions. “The science is clear,” said Deborah Batts, chairwoman of the commission. “The earlier someone starts gambling, the more likely they are to develop a problem.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposal argue that it will drive gambling activities underground and make them harder to regulate. They also argue that it will deprive young people of important economic opportunities.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should the gambling age be raised to 21?</p>
<h1 id="Officials-Vote-to-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#Officials-Vote-to-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Officials Vote to Raise the Gambling Age to 21"></a>Officials Vote to Raise the Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on Wednesday, officials in the state of Washington voted to raise the legal gambling age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, Democratic state Rep. Derek Stanford, said that the change would better protect young people and help to reduce gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important that we do what we can to protect our young people from the potential harms of gambling, which can be significant,” he said.</p>
<p>The move was applauded by anti-gambling groups like Stop Predatory Gambling, who argued that increasing the age would help to prevent younger people from developing gambling addictions.</p>
<p>However, the vote was met with criticism by some casino operators in the state, who warned that it could lead to job losses and decreased tax revenue.</p>
<p>According to estimates from the Washington State Gambling Commission, about two-thirds of people who gamble in the state are under 21 years old. If the new law is passed, they will not be able to wager at casinos or other licensed gaming facilities until they turn 21.</p>
<h1 id="Raising-the-Gambling-Age-to-21-Passes-in-Committee"><a href="#Raising-the-Gambling-Age-to-21-Passes-in-Committee" class="headerlink" title="Raising the Gambling Age to 21 Passes in Committee"></a>Raising the Gambling Age to 21 Passes in Committee</h1><p>In a unanimous vote, the House Judiciary Committee votes to send a bill to the floor that would raise the gambling age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Michael Zalewski of Riverside, would make it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble in Illinois. The proposal would exempt casinos in Illinois, as they are already required to card anyone who looks younger than 25.</p>
<p>“This is about public safety,” Zalewski said in a statement. “Raising the gambling age will help prevent young people from developing gambling addictions and keep them out of harm’s way.”</p>
<p>Zalewski’s proposal has been met with some opposition, including from the Illinois Gaming Board, which says it could lead to a loss of revenue for the state. But as support for the measure has grown in recent years, especially after several high-profile cases of compulsive gambling by young people, legislators seem eager to take up the bill.</p>
<p>If it passes the full House and Senate, Illinois would become the fourth state in the country to raise its gambling age to 21, joining Utah, Hawaii and Alaska.</p>
<h1 id="New-Bill-Proposes-to-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#New-Bill-Proposes-to-Raise-the-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="New Bill Proposes to Raise the Gambling Age to 21"></a>New Bill Proposes to Raise the Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>A new bill has been proposed in the Senate that would raise the gambling age to 21. The bill, called the “Restore America’s Wire Act”, was proposed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah.</p>
<p>The main reason for this proposal is to help protect children and adolescents from the dangers of gambling. Studies have shown that gambling can be addictive and harmful to young people, and raising the age limit would help to prevent them from accessing gambling games and services.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it is unnecessary and could hurt business interests. They argue that people who are old enough to vote or drink should also be allowed to gamble.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no vote on the bill, and it is still under consideration.</p>
