#  Court Rules in Favor of New Jersey to Legalize Sports Gambling

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled on Monday that the federal law prohibiting sports gambling is unconstitutional. This overturns the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) and allows New Jersey to legalize sports gambling.

This is a huge victory for New Jersey, as they have been fighting for the right to legalize sports gambling for years. Governor Phil Murphy celebrated the ruling, stating, "I am thrilled that the Third Circuit has sided with New Jersey and struck down PASPA. This is a great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions about how to allocate their resources."

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was one of the organizations that fought against legalizing sports gambling in New Jersey. They released a statement following the ruling, saying, "While we are still reviewing the decision, we remain committed to protecting the integrity of college sports and our students' ability to compete in a fair and transparent environment."

Several other states are expected to follow New Jersey's lead and legalize sports gambling now that PASPA has been overturned. This could potentially create a massive market for legalized sports betting, which is currently worth an estimated $150 billion.

#  NFL and NBA Battle Over Future of Sports Gambling

On one side of the table, the National Football League (NFL) is lobbying hard for a carve-out that would exempt it from any new federal regulation of sports gambling. The NFL’s argument? That its games are “national events” that should not be sullied by the taint of gambling.

And on the other side of the table is the National Basketball Association (NBA), led by commissioner Adam Silver, which has been a vocal proponent for legalizing and regulating sports gambling. Silver argues that such a step would bring billions of dollars in new revenue to the NBA (and other professional sports leagues), as well as provide much-needed consumer protections against corruption and game-fixing.

Who will win this battle? It’s hard to say, but it seems likely that some form of legalized gambling will eventually be approved in the United States – especially now that the Supreme Court has struck down the federal ban on state-level sports betting.

Until then, we can expect to see plenty more lobbying – and plenty more heated arguments – on both sides of this issue.

#  DraftKings and FanDuel File Lawsuits Against New Jersey After Sports Betting Ruling

On Monday, both DraftKings and FanDuel filed lawsuits against the state of New Jersey after the Supreme Court struck down a law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting. The law in question, PASPA, was passed in 1992 and had effectively prevented any state other than Nevada from legalizing sports betting.

In their lawsuits, both DraftKings and FanDuel argue that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution by regulating states’ rights to make their own decisions regarding gambling. They also argue that PASPA unfairly targets daily fantasy sports companies while permitting traditional sports betting operators to continue operating.

Monday’s decision by the Supreme Court represented a major victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting for legalization for years. Governor Phil Murphy hailed the ruling as “a great day for Atlantic City and for NJ,” and said that he plans to work with state lawmakers to “enact a law authorizing and regulating sports betting in as expeditious a manner as possible.”

It remains unclear exactly how New Jersey will move forward with legalizing sports betting, but it is expected that regulations will be put in place fairly quickly. In the meantime, both DraftKings and FanDuel are hoping to get ahead of the competition by establishing themselves as the go-to brands for legalized sports betting.

#  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Warns NFL, NBA About Litigation

On Monday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie warned the NFL and NBA about possible litigation if the leagues don't move their 2017 all-star games out of the state.

Christie said that he's sent letters to both leagues, explaining that the state's Sports and Entertainment Commission would file a lawsuit seeking damages if the games aren't moved.

"This is not a threat," Christie said at a news conference. "This is me informing them of what the law is."

The law in question is a new one that was signed by Christie in October. It allows for sports betting in New Jersey, but only if it's done through state-licensed casinos and racetracks. The NFL and NBA have both voiced opposition to the law, claiming that it will impact the integrity of their games.

Both leagues have already announced that they will not be holding their all-star games in New Jersey next year. The NFL has decided to move its game to Miami, while the NBA has chosen Toronto.

Christie said on Monday that he's disappointed with both decisions, but added that he respects the leagues' right to make them. He also defended his state's new sports betting law, calling it "common-sense reform."

"I'm sorry they don't like it, but they don't get to dictate to us what we can do and can't do in our state," Christie said.

#  Christie: 'I Told You So' to NFL, NBA on Sports Betting

In a recent interview with the Associated Press, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had some harsh words for the NFL and NBA brass on the issue of sports betting.

"I told them this was going to happen," said Christie of his conversations with league officials. "They didn't want to listen."

Christie has been an outspoken advocate of legalizing and regulating sports betting in New Jersey, arguing that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. His efforts have been repeatedly thwarted by both the NFL and NBA, which have argued that legalized sports betting would damage the integrity of their games.

With the Supreme Court preparing to rule on New Jersey's case later this year, Christie is reveling in his vindication. "The leagues were wrong," he said. "And they're going to have to live with that."

Christie has also taken shots at the NCAA, which has opposed New Jersey's efforts tooth and nail. "The NCAA is a bunch of hypocrites," he said. "They make all this money off of amateur athletes and then turn around and try to block them from making a little bit of money on their own."

It will be interesting to see how the leagues react if the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey later this year. The NFL and NBA have long maintained that legalized sports betting is a threat to their integrity, but with more and more states jumping on the legalization bandwagon, they may be forced to change their tune.
