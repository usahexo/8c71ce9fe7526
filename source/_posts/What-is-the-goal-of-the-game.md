#  How much does the game cost to play?

When it comes to how much a game costs, it can vary greatly. For console games, there is usually a purchase price for the game itself and then potential costs associated with DLC (downloadable content) that may be available after the game's initial release. For PC games, there may also be a purchase price as well as monthly subscription fees for online play, depending on the game. Additionally, many mobile games are either offered for free with in-game microtransactions or have a very low purchase price.

Generally, console games cost more than PC games, and PC games usually require more expensive hardware than consoles do in order to play them. Mobile games are almost always the cheapest option, though they often come with shorter gameplay times and/or less content overall. In general, it seems that developers and publishers are trending towards lower and lower prices for their products in order to entice more players to spend money on their titles.
