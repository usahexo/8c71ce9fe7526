#  RB Leipzig offer guide to casino profits as Bundesliga season kicks off 

RB Leipzig became the Bundesliga’s sixth club to go public when they announced their offer of shares to the general public in February 2016. The Saxony-based club hope to raise €60 million from the sale of around 10% of the company, valuing RB Leipzig at €600 million.

The proceeds from the share issue will be used for the construction of a new training ground and for youth development. The club also wants to invest in its infrastructure, including a new VIP area and an enlarged business area. RB Leipzig is also looking into the possibility of building a new stadium, but no decision has yet been made on that front.

Commercial director Robert Schäfer outlined some of the key opportunities and challenges facing the Bundesliga newcomers in an interview with Reuters in March 2016:

"There are many challenges, we are starting from scratch really," Schafer said. "We have to make sure that our players perform on the pitch, our fans feel well taken care of and that we are commercially successful."

RB Leipzig stormed to second place in their first season in Germany's top flight, narrowly missing out on automatic Champions League qualification behind Bayern Munich. Their success has been built on a strong youth policy, with stars such as Timo Werner and Naby Keita emerging from the club's academy.

The company behind RB Leipzig is Red Bull GmbH, which is associated with Austrian energy drink maker Red Bull. The billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz bought a majority stake in Austrian football club SV Austria Salzburg in 2005 and rebranded them as Red Bull Salzburg. The following year he founded RB Leipzig as an affiliated club.

Red Bull's approach has proved controversial with some fans and football traditionalists who argue that it amounts to "marketing" teams rather than supporting genuine football clubs. There have been protests against Red Bull's ownership of both Salzburg and Leipzig, with some groups even calling for a boycott of products associated with the company. A banner displayed during RB Leipzig's match against Wolfsburg read "football without fans is nothing" - a slogan that could just as easily apply to any number of businesses.

Despite (or perhaps because of) such opposition, RB Leipzig continue to thrive both on and off the pitch. The Saxony-based club offer investors a unique opportunity to get exposure to Germany's top flight Bundesliga while taking part in one of the most controversial ownership stories in world football.

In this article, you will find all the tips you need to profit at the casino this season while betting on RB Leipzig.

RB Leipzig have had a great season so far and are currently in second place in the Bundesliga, just behind Bayern Munich. They are a very exciting team to watch and have already scored 54 goals in their 26 league games this season. This makes them one of the most attacking teams in the Bundesliga and also means that they are likely to score plenty of goals, which provides us with some great betting opportunities.

In this article, we will take a look at how to profit from betting on RB Leipzig in the casino. We will look at their odds for different types of bets and provide you with some tips on how to make money while betting on them. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the best bets to place on RB Leipzig in the casino this season.

Bundesliga Outright Win Odds

RB Leipzig are considered one of the favourites to win the Bundesliga this season and they are currently priced at odds of 7/2 with some bookmakers. This makes them third favourites behind Bayern Munich (1/6) and Borussia Dortmund (5/1), but they are still well-priced given their excellent form this season. They have already beaten both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund this season, so they definitely have what it takes to win the Bundesliga title.

If you fancy backing RB Leipzig to win the Bundesliga title this season, then now is definitely a good time to do so. Their odds may well shorten as we approach the end of the season, so now could be your chance to make some healthy profits by backing them at favourable odds.

Match Odds

RB Leipzig are also priced very competitively for individual matches throughout the Bundesliga season. For example, their match odds against Hamburger SV this weekend range from 3/10 all the way up to 4/7, depending on which bookmaker you use. This makes them clear favourites to win against Hamburger SV and provides us with some excellent betting opportunities.

Other matches that offer good value include their away game against Schalke 04 next month, where they can be backed at odds of 13/8 with most bookmakers. This is a great opportunity to back RB Leipzig for an away victory as Schalke 04 have been struggling for form recently. Another good match to bet on is their home game against Bayer Leverkusen later on in the season, where they can be backed at odds of 11/10 with most bookmakers. Bayer Leverkusen are one of RB Leipzig’s main rivals for a place in Europe next season, so expect a close match between these two teams.

#  RB Leipzig reveal how to make a killing at the casino throughout the Bundesliga season 

Since their promotion to the Bundesliga in 2016, RB Leipzig have been one of the most exciting and profitable clubs to bet on. With a consistent record of outperforming expectations, they offer punters plenty of opportunities to make a killing on a game-by-game basis.

However, Casino.com experts have recently revealed that there is one specific way to make money off Leipzig throughout the Bundesliga season – by betting on them to win at the casino.

A recent study of all 355 Bundesliga games played by RB Leipzig since their promotion shows that they are far more likely to win when playing away from home than at their Red Bull Arena.

In fact, out of the 111 games played on the road, RB Leipzig have won an impressive 60% of them – compared to just 45% of the games played at home. This gives punters a clear advantage when betting on them to win away from home, as the odds are significantly higher than for a home victory.

What’s more, this trend has been consistent throughout RB Leipzig’s time in the Bundesliga; in each of their three seasons they have won more games on the road than at home. So if you want to make some serious profits from betting on RB Leipzig, it’s definitely worth looking at away fixtures as your best option.

So what are you waiting for? Start making some profits today by betting on RB Leipzig to win away from home!
