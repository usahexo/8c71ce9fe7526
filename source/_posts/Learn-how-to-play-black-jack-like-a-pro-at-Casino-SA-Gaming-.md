#  Learn how to play black jack like a pro at Casino SA Gaming 

Are you looking for ways to improve your black jack game? Look no further than Casino SA Gaming. With years of experience, our team can help you up your game and win more often.

The first step is to understand the basic rules of black jack. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The aim is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Aces count as either 1 or 11, 2-10 are face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are all 10 points each.

Once you have the basics down, it’s time to start learning some strategies. One of the most important is to know when to hit and when to stand. Generally, you want to hit if your hand is below 17 and stand if your hand is at 17 or over. However, there are exceptions to this rule, so it’s important to be aware of what they are. For example, if the dealer has a low card (2-6), you might want to hit even if your hand is 17 or over, as there is a good chance the dealer will bust (go over 21).

If you want to increase your chances of winning even further, consider using basic strategy charts. These charts show the best decisions for any given situation, taking into account your hand and the dealer’s up card. You can find plenty of free charts online or in books on black jack strategy.

Another key element of mastering black jack is knowing when to split cards and when to double down. Splitting cards allows you to play two hands at once, which can increase your chances of winning – especially if you get a pair early on. Doubling down means doubling your bet after seeing your first two cards – but you can only do this if your hand totals 9, 10 or 11.

As with any casino game, black jack comes with its own set of risks and rewards. By following the tips mentioned above and practising regularly at Casino SA Gaming ,you can give yourself the best chance possible of coming out on top. So why not try it for yourself today?

#  Black jack guide for beginners - Learn how to play from the pros 

If you're looking to learn how to play blackjack, look no further. This guide will teach you everything you need to know in order to get started playing the game like a pro.

Before getting into the specifics of how to play, let's first discuss the basic rules of blackjack. The object of the game is to draw cards until your hand totals 21 or comes as close as possible without going over (this is also known as a "blackjack"). The player's hand is compared against the dealer's hand, and the player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand. If the player's hand and the dealer's hand are both the same, it is called a "push" and no one wins or loses money.

Now that you understand the basics of blackjack, let's discuss some of the specific strategies that you can use when playing. One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to always take into account what cards are left in the deck. For example, if there are a lot of low cards remaining in the deck, then you'll want to bet more aggressively since there is a higher probability that your next card will be a high card. Conversely, if there are a lot of high cards remaining in the deck, then you'll want to bet more conservatively since your next card is more likely to be a low card.

In addition to considering what cards are left in the deck, you should also try to keep track of which cards have been played. This information can help inform your decisions about whether to hit or stand. For example, if there are only three high cards remaining in the deck and two have already been played, then it's likely that your next card will be one of the low cards remaining in the deck. In this case, you would probably want to hit since there is a good chance that your next card will be a high card and give you better odds of winning.

Another thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is that it's important to set limits on how much money you're willing to lose. This way, even if you do end up losing money while playing, you won't end up going broke in the process. Finally, another great tip for beginners is to practice playing online before venturing out into live casinos. This way, you'll get comfortable with all of the different rules and jargon associated with blackjack before risking any real money while playing.

#  Master black jack with our easy to follow guide from Casino SA Gaming



Gambling can be a fun and thrilling pastime but it's important to know the game you're playing before risking your money. Mastering black jack doesn't require any innate talent, just some basic strategy which we'll outline in this guide.

Black jack is a relatively simple game to play. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding this amount. Cards are worth their face value with the exception of an Ace, which can be worth 1 or 11 depending on what suits the player best at the time.

The player goes first and can either take another card (hit) or stick with what they have (stand). When both the player and dealer have either hit or stood, the hands are revealed and the winner is determined. If the player has more than 21, they bust and lose regardless of what the dealer has. If the dealer has more than 21, they bust and all players still in the game win their bets. If both player and dealer have 21, it's a draw and everyone gets their money back.

Now that you know how to play black jack, let's take a look at some basic strategy for getting closer to 21 without going bust. The following tips will help you manage your bankroll while increasing your chances of winning:

- Always stand if you have 17 or more - This increases your chances of winning by not taking any additional cards which could lead to you going over 21.

- Double down on 11 - When you double down, you place an additional bet equal to your original bet and receive just one more card. This is a risky move but if you're confident in your hand, doubling down on 11 can be a good way to increase your chances of winning.

- Split pairs of eights or aces - When you split pairs, you place an additional bet equal to your original bet and receive two new cards playable as two separate hands. This can be a good way to increase your chances of winning provided both hands are playable.

- Avoid betting on tie games - A tie bet pays out 8-1 but statistically speaking, it's not worth betting on these games since the odds are against you winning.

 By following these tips, you'll give yourself the best chance of winning at black jack!
